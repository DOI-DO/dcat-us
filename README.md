# DCAT-US-Schema-v3.0
DCAT-US Schema v3.0 (FAIRness Project Metadata Schema)

The Building Trust and FAIRness into the Process for Finding and Using Government Data Project (FAIRness Project) is a joint project of the Chief Data Officers Council (CDOC) and the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (FCSM—in consultation with the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP)). The FAIRness Project will advance efforts toward improving and enhancing data users’ (both internal and external to the federal government) ability to find and assess the utility of federal data essential to implementing the new data sharing authorities under Title III of the Evidence Act.


The FAIRness Project’s scope focuses on development and delivery of three products:

1. An updated DCAT-US v1.1 schema to a United States profile consistent with DCAT version 3.

Update the DCAT-US Schema v1.1 (Project Open Data Metadata Schema) profile to improve customer experience, increase interoperability across federal data catalogs and decrease agency burdens. The update will improve access to data and align the schema with international standards. Aligning with international standards is likely to improve the adoption by software vendors and open-source technologies. DCAT version 3 better supports limited geospatial metadata, allowing for a combined endpoint to service data.gov, with pointers to geospatial metadata in the Geoplatform. 

An updated DCAT-US Schema and a DCAT-US schema governance process will meet customer needs for finding and using federal data assets while enabling interoperability across federal data catalogs such as the Standard Application Procedure (SAP), Data.gov and the Geoplatform. The project team also will develop documentation explaining the update from DCAT POD 1.1 to DCAT version 3 as well as use cases and documentation communicating the value to agencies in adopting metadata standards and utilizing DCAT version 3.

2. The design of proposed metadata standard governance model

The team will develop and propose a set of processes and governance structure to manage future updates of the DCAT-US schema. These processes will be consistent with OMB Circular A-119, be transparent and reflect the multitude of stakeholders and service providers. The governance approach will be tested and refined through this project. The team will estimate the resource requirements to manage the governance into the future. The proposed future governance model would be provided to CDOC and ICSP for consideration and further recommendation to OMB.

3. A sequencing plan for improving metadata discovery, assessment, and use, consistent with FAIR Principles

The team will develop a strategic two-year sequencing plan to improve data discovery and appropriate use for evidence which identifies opportunities to improve and integrate government-wide metadata cataloging consistent with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable/Reproducible) principles. This task will identify steps that all agencies can follow to improve data access for evidence building by making data easier to find (locate), access, assess (for fitness-for-use), and use. In addition, the sequencing plan will suggest metrics to measure the implementation and progress of metadata creation and maintenance solutions, such as those previously identified by the CDOC Data Inventory Working Group, and consistent with the FCSM’s Framework for Data Quality. The plan will clarify the actions required and the organizations that should execute them consistent in accordance with FAIR principles, statute, and policy.
