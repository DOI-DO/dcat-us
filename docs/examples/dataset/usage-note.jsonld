  "usageNote": "The MAPPE model is a collection of ArcGIS raster calculations, \n        originally implemented in VBA for ArcGIS 9.x; as this environment \n        is obsolete, the author recommends to develop the calculations \n        anew just by picking the syntax from the reports. Anyway, the \n        value of the work is in the data and concept more than in the \n        original scripts."
